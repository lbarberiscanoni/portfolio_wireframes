portfolio_wireframes
====================
#Version 1

It's inspired by Vox.com and their use of cards. 

A progressively higher number of cards is shown with progressively higher screen sizes. 

Clicking on each card's header opens up a separate page in a new tab with the specific blog post or project in full screen.

#Version 2

This layout is social media heavy.

Although not really possible in a small size, the idea is to have the picture horizontally right next to a brief description of the project.

The blog posts are in full from the very beginning.

The pictures that separate each section will change every time Tumblr-style.

#Version 3

This one was not inspired by anything specifically. It's more of me exploring different concenpts.

The module for the projects is still a card-based system, but not the flat one of Vox. 

    No description, just a picture. If the user is interested he or she can go to the project's unique page or share it.

I like widgets. The Instagram widget is reserved for larger screen sizes because it is the least important from a professional standpoint.

Gallery pictures are of me working with my clients to hopefully humanize the process of working with me. 

    Hopefully people will be smiling in those pictures XD
